Try various command lines in github.

Working with git push: edit in local directory, save, git add, git commit, git push

But before push, one must git pull first if any other user pushed anything to the repo. Or "non-fast-forward" error will occur and push will be rejected.

git commit -a -m 'commit message here' 
-a allows you to skip stage process, meaning skip git add.
