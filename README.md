June 30, 2013. Reading Git ebook http://git-scm.com/book 
and get started, try various command lines in github.
Working with git push: edit in local directory, save, git add, git commit, git push
But before push, one must git pull first if any other user pushed anything to the repo. Or "non-fast-forward" error will occur and push will be rejected.
